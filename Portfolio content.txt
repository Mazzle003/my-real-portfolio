An upcoming web developer and programmer 




About me section:


I am an upcoming web developer who loves to write codes and create stunning designs. 




My Skills:


Writing codes:


Due to my inquisitive nature (When i kean inquisitive, i mean exploring and successfully scattering the settings of any device that comes my way😜) my big suggests i venture into tech, which was a very nice idea because ever since i have started writing codes, i drastically fell in love with the tech niche and wants to go further. 


Content writing 

My skill isn't limited to code writing and website development. My love for writing contents is also something that cannot be distinguished. 


Problem solving


As a developer, problem is something that cannot be avoided, either when marking up trxts or styling, there's always one issue or the other  and solving these problems can be sometimes stressing and teeth nagging and that's where my problem solving skills come in handy 


My Hobbies:


Learning:


As an upcoming web developer who wants to achieve a very high level of professionalism, learning is something that cannot be avoided. So, i like learning new things that would broaden my thinking mechanism, which further leads to productivity. 


Eating:


Well, I would say this particular hobby is associated with almost everyone (lol, no one hates eating). Eating makes me active and that's why i eat even when am not hungry. 


Playing Football games:


Something common among most tech guys is the love for games. Gaming helps to build one's creative and strategic thinking and thats why am a fan. I love football games, especially FC24.
